## About this project

Interactive learning is [more effective](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/09/210930140710.htm) than traditional methods. [Learners remember](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-does-interactive-learning-boost-outcomes/) 10% of what they hear, 20% of what they read but 80% of what they see and do. That's why 34 hours of Duolingo [are equivalent](https://support.duolingo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000035183-Are-there-official-studies-about-Duolingo-) to a full university semester of language education.

We love Duolingo. We think those kinds of interactive experiences should be used in more fields. That's why we're building Zoonk, an open-source platform to create interactive courses like Duolingo.

## Getting started

Follow the instructions below to get Zoonk up and running on your local machine. We have a `Dockerfile` for deploying our demo app to [Fly](https://fly.io/). For using Docker locally, [see this](./local/README.md).

### Requirements

- **Elixir 1.17+** and **Erlang 26+**. Run `elixir -v` to find your current version for [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) and [Erlang](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html#installing-erlang).
- **Hex**: `mix local.hex`.
- **Phoenix**: `mix archive.install hex phx_new`.
- **PostgreSQL 15+**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
- (Linux users only): [inotify-tools](https://github.com/inotify-tools/inotify-tools/wiki).

### Local development

- Run `mix setup` to install dependencies and set up the database and assets.
- Run `mix seed` to fetch initial data to the database ([See options](./priv/repo/seed/README.md)).
- Run `mix phx.server` to start a development server.
- Run `mix test` to run tests.
- Run `mix ci` to run code quality checks.
- Run `mix locale` to update translation files.

## SSL on localhost

Prefer to do local development using SSL to resemble production as much as possible. You can use [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to generate a certificate. After you install `mkcert`, follow the steps below:

- Create a `cert` directory under `priv`: `mkdir priv/cert`.
- Generate a new certificate: `mkcert -key-file priv/cert/selfsigned_key.pem -cert-file priv/cert/selfsigned.pem localhost zoonk.test "*.zoonk.test" apple.test`.
- Run `mkcert -install` to install the certificate in the system trust store.
- You may also need to enable `Allow invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost` on [Google Chrome flags](chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost).
- Restart your local server: `mix phx.server`. You may also need to restart your browser.

You also need to make sure your machine maps `localhost` to a test domain (we're using `zoonk.test` for this guide). `dnsmasq` allows you to resolve domains to your local machine without having to change your `/etc/hosts` file. To install `dnsmasq`:

```sh
brew install dnsmasq

# Create a configuration directory
mkdir -pv $(brew --prefix)/etc/

# Set up your domains
echo 'address=/zoonk.test/127.0.0.1' >> $(brew --prefix)/etc/dnsmasq.conf
echo 'address=/.zoonk.test/127.0.0.1' >> $(brew --prefix)/etc/dnsmasq.conf
echo 'address=/apple.test/127.0.0.1' >> $(brew --prefix)/etc/dnsmasq.conf

# Add dnsmasq to your resolver
sudo mkdir -v /etc/resolver
sudo bash -c 'echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" > /etc/resolver/zoonk.test'
sudo bash -c 'echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" > /etc/resolver/apple.test'

# Start dnsmasq
sudo brew services start dnsmasq
```

That's it! You can now start your local server (`mix phx.server`) and test your domains using:

- https://zoonk.test:4001
- https://apple.zoonk.test:4001 (each school slug can be used as a subdomain of `zoonk.test`).
- Or any other domain you added before.

## Mailer

We're using [Resend](https://resend.com) to send emails. To make it work in production, you need to set the following environment variables on your server:

- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Your Resend API key.

## Storage

You need to use an S3-compatible storage service to store your files. At Zoonk, we're using [Tigris](https://tigrisdata.com/). You need to add the following environment variables:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key ID.
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret access key.
- `AWS_REGION`: Your AWS region.
- `BUCKET_NAME`: Your AWS bucket name.
- `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3`: Your AWS endpoint URL.
- `AWS_CDN_URL`: Your AWS CDN URL (optional. If missing, we'll use the S3 endpoint URL).
- `CSP_CONNECT_SRC`: Your S3 domain (i.e. `https://fly.storage.tigris.dev`).
